## SELF INTRO
Hello Everyone,<br>
I'm Sabarinath J, currently doing my 1st semester in CSE AI at Amirthapuri campus. While my early passion for hardware electronics still burns, it's the software side that truly ignites my spirit. Coding something and having it work feels good, apart from solving complex codes that fill me with excitement. This magnetic attraction to coding has guided my academic journey, where conquering challenges and mastering coding , algorithmic shapes not just my career path, but my personal development. With determination, I'm committed to blending hardware with software skill and problem-solving. As I stand on the edge of academia and curiosity, my goal is to translate this dream into meaningful contributions, leaving a notable mark on the world of technology. I know basics of coding and wanting to lean more from everyone and this all made me chose to pursue a course thatâ€™s related to AI.

## New Beginning

I failed in the first interview cause of not clearly expalining what i did and wans't able to conveay whats on mty mind. This second chance given to me, which i am really greatful i would take my past mistake as reference and will do the task.

## Purely terminal

During my interview I was asked to make a github repo from terminal which i hadn't known that time . but this time the whole process making this repo and adding everything to it was done by using terminal only.
