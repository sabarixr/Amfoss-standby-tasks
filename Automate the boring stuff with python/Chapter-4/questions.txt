For the following three questions, let’s say spam contains the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].

3. What does spam[int(int('3' * 2) // 11)] evaluate to?

Answer:
        int(int('3' * 2) // 11) this evaluates to 33// 11 which is 3
        spam[3] which is 'd'


4. What does spam[-1] evaluate to?

Answer:
        index -1 denotes the last element.
        spam[-1] gives 'd'


5. What does spam[:2] evaluate to?

        spam[:2] outputs ['a', 'b']


For the following three questions, let’s say bacon contains the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True].

6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?

Answer:
        bacon.index('cat') returns 1.


7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?

Answer:
        [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]


8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?

Answer:
        taking bacon as [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True]
        then bacon.remove('cat) returns [3.14, 11, 'cat', True]


9. What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?

Answer:
        for list concatenation : +

12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.

Answer:
        - Both can use teh len() function.
        - Both can be indexed.
        - replication of element uses * in both same for concatenation.


13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?

Answer:
        List is mutable while tuples are not ie, you can add, remove , edit elements from a list while tuple doesnt allow that
