3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).

Answer:
	|         and         |        |          or          |      |      not      |

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)

	!= : Not Equal to 
	<  : Less than
	>  : Greater than
	<= : Less than or Equal to
	>= : Greater than or Equal to
	
6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?

Answer: 
	== (equal to) checks weather the values in both sides are equal, if equal return True else return False.
	= (assigemnt operator) assigns a value to a variavble.
	
	
7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.

Answer:
	Condition is basically True or False. It is used to control the program.

8. Identify the three blocks in this code:

spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')
    else:
        print('ham')
    print('spam')
print('spam')

Answer:
	The first block of code starts at the line      print('eggs')    till second last line.
	Second block of code is single line             print('bacon').   
	Third is also single block                      print('ham')
	
9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam,
 prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.	

Answer: 
	code is attached sepratly in the same folder named 9.py
	
10. What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?
	
Answer:

12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?
	
Answer:
	range(10)       - This creates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 9.
	range(0, 10)    - This also creates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 9. it ahs starting value = 0 and ending value = 10.
	range(0, 10, 1) - This also creates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 9. it ahs starting value = 0 and ending value = 10 with intervel = 1.
	
13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

Answer:
	The codes are saved as for_13.py and whilie_13.py
